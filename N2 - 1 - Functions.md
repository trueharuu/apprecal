# Topic: Functions

## Relation
A rule of correspondence between two sets of
quantities. A relation can take the form of `mappings, graphs, or equations`.

## Function
A relation which `has exactly one y-value for every x-value`. No x-value can be used twice with different y-values. Graph will pass the Vertical Line Test.
- X is the `domain` (input)
- Y is the `range` (output)

## Domain
The set of all possible `inputs` for which the expression is defined. The domain may be determined by the graph or equation.

## Range
The set of all possible `outputs` for a given relation. The range is usually easiest to find from the graph, not from the equation.

## Interval Notation
| Inequality      | Interval       |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| $3 \le x \le 5$ | $[3, 5]$       |
| $3 \lt x \lt 5$ | $(3, 5)$       |
| $x \ge 5$       | $[5, +\infty)$ |
| $x \gt 5$       | $(5, +\infty)$ |

## Function Notation
```rs
f(x) = 3x - 5
^ --- name of the function
```
`f(x)` is the y value (output) for a given `x`

## 
State the domain and range using interval notation. State whether the relation is a function.

**Note: Always read a graph from left to right (as x increases).**

Domain: $(-\infty, 7)$
Range: $(-\infty, 4)$

## One-To-One Function
A function which `has exactly one x-value for every y-value, and exactly one y-value for every x-value`. No x-value or y-value can be used twice. Graph will be a function that also passes the Horizontal Line Test.

## x-intercept
`Values for x where f(x) = +0` $(a, 0)$

*Also called `roots` or `zeroes` of a function.*

## y-intercept
`Values for f(0)` $(0, b)$

## Increasing
A function is increasing on an interval if `the y-value increases as the x-value increases within that interval`.

*For every $a, b \in I$ in an interval $I$, if $a > b$ and $f(a) > f(b)$, then $f(x)$ is increasing on $I$*
## Decreasing
A function is decreasing on an interval if `the y-value decreases as the x-value increases within that interval`.

*For every $a, b \in I$ in an interval $I$, if $a > b$ and $f(a) < f(b)$, then $f(x)$ is decreasing on $I$*

## Constant
A function is constant on an interval if `the y-value does not change within the interval`.

*For every $a, b \in I$ in an interval $I$, if $a > b$ and $f(a) = f(b)$, then $f(x)$ is constant on $I$*


## Analyze the following graphs.

1. Function?
> $\text{Yes}$
2. Domain:
> $(-4, 9)$
3. Range:
> $\lbrack-3.5, 5\rparen$
4. What is $f(3)$?
> $-2$
5. Where is $f(x) = 3$?
> $x = -3$, $x = 6$
6. What is $f(0)$?
> $-3$
7. Where is $f(x) = 0$?
> $x = \set{-2, 4, 8}$
8. Where is $f(x) > 0$?
> $(-4, -2) \cup (4, 8)$
9.  x-intercepts:
> $x = \set{-2, 4, 8}$
10.  y-intercepts:
> $(0, -3)$
11. 1-to-1 Function?
> $\text{No}$

### Give the intervals where:
12. $f$ is increasing
> $(1.1, 6)$
13. $f$ is decreasing
> $(-4, 1.1) \cup (6, 9)$
14. $f$ is constant
> (none)
15. Where $f(x) = -2$?
> $x = \set{-1, 3, 9}$

## Graph 2
16. Function?
> $\text{Yes}$
17. Domain:
> $(-\infty, -3) \cup (-3, +\infty)$
18. Range:
> $[-3, +\infty)$
19. What is $f(1)$?
> $2$
20. Where is $f(x) = +1$?
> $\set{0, 8.25}$
21.  What is $f(0)$?
> $1$
22.  Where is `$f(x) = 0$?
> $x = \set{-1, 4, 8}$
23.  Where is $f(x) <= 0$?
> $(-\infty, -3) \cup (-3, -1] \cup [4, 8]$
- Justify your answer to #23:
> Visibly underneath the X-axis, remove $x = -3$ as $\text{undefined} <= 0$ doesn't give a value
24. Zeroes:
> $x = \set{-1, 4, 8}$
25. y-intercept:
> $y = 1$
26. 1-to-1 Function?
> $\text{No}$

### Give the intervals where:
27. $f$ is increasing
> $(-4, -3) \cup (-3, 2) \cup (+6, +\infty)$
28. $f$ is decreasing
> $(2, 7)$
29. $f$ is constant
> $(-\infty, -4)$
30. Find $f(2)$:
> $3$
