# Topic: Functions

## Relation
A rule of correspondence between two sets of
quantities. A relation can take the form of `mappings, graphs, or equations`.

## Function
A relation which `has exactly one y-value for every x-value`. No x-value can be used twice with different y-values. Graph will pass the Vertical Line Test.
- X is the `domain` (input)
- Y is the `range` (output)

## Domain
The set of all possible `inputs` for which the expression is defined. The domain may be determined by the graph or equation.

## Range
The set of all possible `outputs` for a given relation. The range is usually easiest to find from the graph, not from the equation.

## Interval Notation
| Inequality    | Interval          |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| `3 <= x <= 5` | `[+3, +5]`        |
| `3 < x < 5`   | `(+3, +5)`        |
| `x >= 5`      | `[+5, +Infinity)` |
| `x > 5`       | `(+5, +Infinity)` |

## Function Notation
```rs
f(x) = 3x - 5
^ --- name of the function
```
`f(x)` is the y value (output) for a given `x`

## 
State the domain and range using interval notation. State whether the relation is a function.

**Note: Always read a graph from left to right (as x increases).**

Domain: `(-Infinity, +7)`
Range: `(-Infinity, +4)`

## One-To-One Function
A function which `has exactly one x-value for every y-value, and exactly one y-value for every x-value`. No x-value or y-value can be used twice. Graph will be a function that also passes the Horizontal Line Test.

## x-intercept
`Values for x where f(x) = +0` (a, 0)

*Also called `roots` or `zeroes` of a function.*

## y-intercept
`Values for f(+0)` (0, b)

## Increasing
A function is increasing on an interval if `the y-value increases as the x-value increases within that interval`.

*For every `(a, b)` in an interval, if `a > b` then `f(a) > f(b)`*
## Decreasing
A function is decreasing on an interval if `the y-value decreases as the x-value increases within that interval`.

*For every `(a, b)` in an interval, if `a > b` then `f(a) < f(b)`*

## Constant
A function is constant on an interval if `the y-value does not change within the interval`.

*For every `(a, b)` in an interval, `f(a) = f(b)`*


## Analyze the following graphs.

1. Function?
> Yes
2. Domain:

3. Range:
> [-3.5, +5)
4. What is `f(+3)`?
> -2
5. Where is `f(x) = +3`?
> x = -3, x = +6
6. What is `f(+0)`?
> -3
7. Where is `f(x) = +0`?
> x = -2, x = +4, x = +8
8. Where is `f(x) > +0`?
> (-4, -2), (+4, +8) *(intervals)*
9.  x-intercepts:
> x = -2, x = +4, x = +8
10. y-intercepts:
> (+0, -3)
11. 1-to-1 Function?
> No

Give the intervals where:
12. `f` is increasing
> (+1.1, +6)
13. `f` is decreasing
> (-4, +1.1), (+6, +9) *(intervals)*
14. `f` is constant
> None
15. Where `f(x) = -2`?
> x = -1, x = +3, x = +9

## Graph 2
16. Function?
> Yes
17. Domain:
> (-Infinity, -3) (-3, +Infinity)
18. Range:
> [-3, +Infinity)
19. What is `f(+1)`?
> +2
20. Where is `f(x) = +1`?
> +0, +8.25
21.  What is `f(+0)`?
> +1
22.  Where is `f(x) = +0`?
> x = -1, x = +4, x = +8`
23.  Where is `f(x) <= +0`?
> (-Infinity, -3) (-3, -1] [+4, +8] (intervals)
- Justify your answer to #23:
> Visibly underneath the X-axis, remove `x = -3` as `undefined <= 0` doesn't give a value
24. Zeroes:
> x = -1, x = +4, x = +8
25. y-intercept:
> y = 1
26. 1-to-1 Function?
> No

Give the intervals where:
27. `f` is increasing
> (-4, -3) (-3, +2) (+6, +Infinity) (intervals)
28. `f` is decreasing
> (+2, +7) (intervals)
29. `f` is constant
> (-Infinity, -4) (intervals)
30. Find `f(2)`:
> 3
